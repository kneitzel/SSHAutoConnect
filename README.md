# Java Maven Project

Example Maven Project for a Java Application.

**Update**: Added reporting to create a site (html documentation of project)

**Update**: Java 21 is now fully supported

This project includes:
- Lombok to reduce boilerplate code
- Adding module-info for dependencies that are missing these.
- static code analysis with PMD and spotbugs
- Creation of image (JLink) and app-image (JPackage)
- Creation of native binary (GraalVM)

## Requirements
To use this Template, all you need is a local Java Installation.
My current advice is to use a long term supported (LTS) version of either Java 17 or Java 21.
